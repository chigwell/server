flushall

<fg:blue>Description:<:fg>

The flushall queues command will remove all messages from all queues and thereby remove all the queues theirself.

<bg:blue>Please note:<:bg>
This does not affect consumers which may work on dispatched messages and will eventually acknowledge them.
These acknowledgements will be received, but ignored.
