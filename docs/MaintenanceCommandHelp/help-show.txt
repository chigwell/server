<fg:blue>Description:<:fg>

The show queue command will show the current messages of the given queue name.

<bg:blue>Please note:<:bg>
Not existing queues are shown as empty lists,

 * The message ID of the message (<fg:yellow>Msg-ID<:fg>)
 * The size in human readable bytes of the message (<fg:yellow>Size<:fg>)
 * The date the message was created (<fg:yellow>Created<:fg>)

The message list is refreshed every 0.5 seconds.

You can quit the list by typing "q" and hitting <enter>
